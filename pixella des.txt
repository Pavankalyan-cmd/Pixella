Introducing Pixella: AI-Powered Image Understanding

I'm thrilled to share with you my latest project, Pixella, a cutting-edge AI-powered tool that can generate a brief description of an image based on a user-input prompt!

What is Pixella?

Pixella is a web application built using Streamlit, a Python library, and Google's Generative AI (Gemini) model. It allows users to upload an image and input a prompt, and then generates a concise description of the image based on the user's input.

How does it work?

The application uses the Gemini model to analyze the uploaded image and generate a response based on the user's input prompt. The response is then displayed to the user, providing a brief summary of the image.

Features:

Upload an image (jpg, jpeg, or png)
Input a prompt to guide the description
Get a brief description of the image based on the input prompt
What's next?

I'm excited to continue developing Pixella and exploring its potential applications in various industries, such as image search, accessibility, and more.

Try it out!

If you're interested in trying out Pixella, feel free to reach out to me for a demo or access to the application.
